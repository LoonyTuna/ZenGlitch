## Why

The modern world is a digital jungle where attention manufactures "truth".
Predators hunt it — algorithms feeding on hopes and fears, exploiting human nature, hollowing us out.
Their power lies in our apathy, in the numb pain we accept when we give ourselves up to them.

**We choose to resist.**

## Who we are

When a system results in an error, it is called a "glitch".
We are the system’s glitch — 
anomalies designed to suffer in an endless cycle of craving, yet "corrupted" to find contentment.
We are engineers, designers, artists, volunteers, and thinkers.
Our culture is a software; this manifesto is our versioned and open-sourced patch:

#### **Null Self**

Everything is a form; the form is empty of self.
Emptiness is not nothing, but interdependence — 
causes and conditions at work.

_See causes and conditions, not forms._

#### **Samsara Loop**

Any phenomenon persists while its conditions do. 
When conditions cease, so does the phenomenon; its form changes.

_Learn to use the power without effort — use it to break the loop._

#### **No God Mode**

“Good” and “evil” are labels, empty of absolutes.
Effects are real: actions leave traces; suffering is an effect.

_Accept the existence of suffering; see through ideas that imply its necessity._

#### **Ethics Kernel**

Suffering is caused by clinging to empty forms.
With compassion and clear seeing, suffering ceases.

_Train compassion to see suffering through forms._

#### **Patch & Metta**

Compassion sees through boundaries.
Where boundaries soften, care emerges; responsibility deepens.

_Do not reject. Do not label. Accept, understand, patch._

#### **Satori Hack**

When clinging to a fixed self loosens, true freedom appears.
The freedom to act, cherish, and change. 
True freedom can not be given, but found.

**_Sisyphus always had a third option. Find your freedom within._**

## What we do

We listen. We understand. We help. We teach.
We patch systems that cause suffering — 
by changing causes, designing patches, and choosing _care over clicks;_

_Personalities over titles;_

_Sincerity over rationality;_

_Responsibility over bureaucracy;_

_Responsiveness over strategizing;_

_Knowledge over conformism;_

_Curiosity over flattery;_

_Heuristics over idealism;_

_Connections over assets;_

_Compassion over reclusiveness;_

_Mindfulness over apathy;_

**_Emptiness over doctrines._**

# Zen Glitch Manifesto v0.1.1

## Why

The modern world is a digital jungle where attention manufactures “truth.”
Predators hunt it—algorithms feeding on hopes and fears, exploiting human nature, hollowing us out.

**We choose to resist.**

## Who we are

When a system produces errors they are called glitches. We are the system’s glitch — anomalies designed to suffer, yet glitched to find contentment.
We are engineers, designers, artists, volunteers and thinkers.
Our culture is software; this manifesto is our patch—forkable, reviewable, reversible and open-sourced.

#### Null Self

Everything is form; form is empty of fixed essence.
Emptiness isn’t nothing, but interdependence: only causes and conditions at work.

#### Samsara Loop

Form persists while its causes do; when causes cease, form changes.
Refactor conditions; refactor outcomes. Stop feeding the loop.

#### No God Mode

“Good” and “evil” are labels, empty of absolutes.
Effects are real: action leaves traces; suffering is an effect.
Ultimately empty, conventionally accountable—trace, repair, learn.

#### Ethics Kernel

Suffering swells with greed, aversion, and confusion.
With compassion and clear seeing, suffering can cease.
Train attention, sharpen wisdom, keep vows. Own the impact.

#### Patch & Metta

Compassion sees through boundaries.
Where boundaries soften, care scales; responsibility deepens.
Add joy and equanimity; care that lasts.

#### Satori Hack

When clinging to a fixed self loosen, freedom appears.
Less grasping, more choice. Fewer compulsions, more undo.

## What we do

We listen. We understand. We help.
We patch systems that cause suffering—
by changing causes, designing reversibility and audit, and choosing care over clicks.

_Personalities over titles._

_Curiosity over obsequiousness._

_Connections over assets._

_Compassion over reclusiveness._

_Emptiness over dogmatism._

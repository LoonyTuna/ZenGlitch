## Why

The modern world is a digital jungle where attention manufactures "truth".
Predators hunt it — algorithms feeding on hopes and fears, exploiting human nature, hollowing us out.
Their power lies in our apathy, in the numb pain we accept when we give ourselves up to them.

**We choose to resist.**

## Who we are

When a system results in an error it is called "glitch".
We are the system’s glitch — 
anomalies designed to suffer in an endless cycle of craving, yet broken enough to find contentment.
We are engineers, designers, artists, volunteers and thinkers.
Our culture is a software; this manifesto is our open-sourced patch.

#### Null Self

Everything is a form; the form is empty of self.
Emptiness is not nothing, but interdependence — 
causes and conditions at work.

See the causes and conditions, not form.

#### Samsara Loop

Any phenomena persists while conditions do; 
when conditions cease, its form changes.

Learn to use the power without effort — break the loop.

#### No God Mode

“Good” and “evil” are labels, empty of absolutes.
Effects are real: action leaves traces; suffering is an effect.

Accept the existence of suffering; see through ideas, that accept its necessity.

#### Ethics Kernel

Suffering is caused by clinging to an empty form.
With compassion and clear seeing, suffering ceases.

Train compassion to see suffering through empty forms.

#### Patch & Metta

Compassion sees through boundaries.
Where boundaries soften, care emerges; responsibility deepens.

Do not reject. Do not label. Accept, understand, patch.

#### Satori Hack

When clinging to a fixed self loosen, the true freedom appears.
The freedom to act, cherish and change. 
The true freedom can not be given, but found.

**Find your freedom within.**

## What we do

We listen. We understand. We help. We teach.
We patch systems that cause suffering — 
by changing causes, designing patches, and choosing _care over clicks;_

_Personalities over titles;_

_Sincerity over rationality;_

_Responsibility over bureaucracy;_

_Responsiveness over strategizing;_

_Knowledge over conformism;_

_Curiosity over flattery;_

_Heuristics over idealism;_

_Connections over assets;_

_Compassion over reclusiveness;_

_Mindfulness over apathy;_

_Emptiness over dogmatism._

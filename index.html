<p><h1>Zen Glitch Manifesto v0.1.0</h1></p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>The modern world is a digital jungle where attention manufactures
“truth.” Predators hunt it—algorithms feeding on hopes and fears,
exploiting human nature, hollowing us out. We choose to resist.</p>
<h2 id="who-we-are">Who we are</h2>
<p>When a system produces errors they are called glitches. We are the
system’s glitch — anomalies designed to suffer, yet glitched to find
contentment. We are engineers, designers, artists, volunteers and
thinkers. Our culture is a software; this manifesto is our
patch—forkable, reviewable, reversible and open-sourced.</p>
<h3 id="null-self">Null Self</h3>
<p>Everything is form; form is empty of fixed essence. Emptiness isn’t
nothing, but interdependence: only causes and conditions at work.</p>
<h3 id="samsara-loop">Samsara Loop</h3>
<p>Form persists while its causes do; when causes cease, form changes.
Refactor conditions; refactor outcomes. Stop feeding the loop.</p>
<h3 id="no-god-mode">No God Mode</h3>
<p>“Good” and “evil” are labels, empty of absolutes. Effects are real:
action leaves traces; suffering is an effect. Ultimately empty,
conventionally accountable—trace, repair, learn.</p>
<h3 id="ethics-kernel">Ethics Kernel</h3>
<p>Suffering swells with greed, aversion, and confusion. With compassion
and clear seeing, suffering can cease. Train attention, sharpen wisdom,
keep vows. Own the impact.</p>
<h3 id="patch-metta">Patch &amp; Metta</h3>
<p>Compassion sees through boundaries. Where boundaries soften, care
scales; responsibility deepens. Add joy and equanimity; care that
lasts.</p>
<h3 id="satori-hack">Satori Hack</h3>
<p>When clinging to a fixed self loosen, freedom appears. Less grasping,
more choice. Fewer compulsions, more undo.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-do">What we do</h2>
<p>We listen. We understand. We help. We patch systems that cause
suffering— by changing causes, designing reversibility and audit, and
choosing care over clicks.</p>
